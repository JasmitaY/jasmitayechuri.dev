Personal Website:

Hi there! My name is Jasmita Yechuri and I am a recent graduate from the University of Southern California who studied Computer Science and Business Administration (CS + Business). I'm an **aspiring software engineer, product manager** and **entrepreneur** seeking new grad opportunities to solve problems, gain new experiences, and grow personally in technical and professional aspects.

I look forward to applying my knowledge to create human-centric applications of technology and business to solve social issues. Feel free to shoot me an email anytime!
